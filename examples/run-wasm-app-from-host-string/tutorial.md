# Build and Run a WebAssembly Application with WasmEdge Rust SDK

## Introduction

In this article, we'll walk through how to create a WebAssembly application<sup>[1]</sup> (also *wasm app*) and how to run it over WasmEdge Runtime.

> [1] A WebAssembly application is a common application but compiled into a WebAssembly binary instead of a general execution binary. A wasm app runs in a WebAssembly environment. For convenience, we usually call it a *wasm app*.

## Planning the demo code

We'll create two separate projects for this tutorial:

- `wasm-app` project creates a wasm app, in which a simple greeting message is printed out on the screen.
- `run-wasm-app` project creates a WasmEdge *[**Vm**](https://wasmedge.github.io/WasmEdge/wasmedge_sdk/struct.Vm.html)* instance that loads the binary of `wasm-app` and runs it over WasmEdge Runtime.

The architecture diagram of the projects used in this tutorial is presented below: the green rectangles are the two projects we will created, while the blue ones are the dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Operating System: Ubuntu-20.04+, macOS-11+, Windows WSL2

- Install `rustup` and `Rust`

  Follow the instructions on the official [Rust-lang website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install `rustup` and `Rust`<sup>[2]</sup>; then, run the following command in your terminal program to add `wasm32-wasi`<sup>[3]</sup> target to the toolchain:

  ```bash
  // add the wasm32-wasi compilation target to the toolchain
  rustup target add wasm32-wasi
  ```

  >
  >[2] The version of Rust-language should be 1.63 or above.

- Install WasmEdge Runtime Library

  The WasmEdge Runtime library (`libwasmedge`) is a C++ library, which provides a WebAssembly runtime. In this tutorial we use `WasmEdge v0.11.2`. The [Installation and Uninstallation](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/quick_start/install.html) section of Wasmedge Book gives the methods of installation, or you can also run the following instructions in your terminal program to install:

  ```bash
  // Download and run the installation script
  // The wasmedge library and other relevant files will be installed in the directory of $HOME/.wasmedge
  curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash
  
  // Make the installed binary available in the current session of your terminal program
  source $HOME/.wasmedge/env
  ```

## Building the application

Let's make a directory named `workspace`, in which we'll do all the coding jobs:

```bash
mkdir workspace
cd workspace
```

### Step 1: Creating the wasm application: `wasm-app`

There is no difference between creating a wasm app project and a common Rust application project. In your terminal program, run the following command:

```bash
// in workspace/
// create a Rust application named `wasm-app`
cargo new wasm-app --bin
```

This command will create a directory called `wasm-app` with a boilerplate Rust app inside. Let's navigate into the  `wasm-app/src` directory, open `main.rs` and add the following code in the `main` function:

```rust
// workspace/wasm-app/src/main.rs

fn main() {
  // add the following line
  println!("Greetings from wasm-app!");
}
```

When the wasm app is called later, it will print the message `Greetings from wasm-app!` out in your terminal program.

#### Compile the wasm app

Now let's compile the wasm app into a wasm binary. To do this, just run the following command in your terminal program:

```bash
// in workspace/wasm-app
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release
```

The command will compile the wasm app into `wasm-app.wasm` file that is located in the directory `wasm-app/target/wasm32-wasi/release`.

### Step 2: Creating the host application: `run-wasm-app`

In this step, we'll create a wasm host application, by which to run the wasm app. Run the following command in the root directory `workspace/`

```bash
// in workspace/
cargo new run-wasm-app --bin
```

As we did in step 1, this command will create a Rust application project named `rust-wasm-app`.

#### Add dependencies

Before adding any code in `main.rs`, we'll add a dependency for this project. Let's navigate into the directory `run-wasm-app`, open `Cargo.toml` in the directory `run-wasm-app`, and add `wasmedge-sdk` in the section of  `[dependecies]`:

```tom
[package]
edition = "2021"
name = "run-wasm-app"
version = "0.1.0"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
wasmedge-sdk = "0.6.0"  // add `wasmedge-sdk` crate
```

`wasmedge-sdk` crate defines a group of high-level Rust APIs.  We can use them to, for example, create and manage a WasmEdge *virtual machine*<sup>[4]</sup>, run something in it, and etc..

> <div id="virtual-machine"></div>
>
> [4] In the context of WasmEdge Runtime, virtual machine denotes an instance of `Vm` object. For the details of `Vm`, see [*wasmedge_sdk::Vm*](https://wasmedge.github.io/WasmEdge/wasmedge_sdk/struct.Vm.html).

Now, let's open the file `main.rs` in the directory `run-wasm-app/src`, import some necessary types into our project and make some changes<sup>[5]</sup> on the `main` function:

```rust
// types defined in `wasmedge-sdk` crate
use wasmedge_sdk::{
    config::{CommonConfigOptions, ConfigBuilder, HostRegistrationConfigOptions},
    params, Vm,
};

// `main` function has a return type
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    
    Ok(())
}
```

> <div id="question-operator"></div>
>
> [5] We added a return type to the original `main` function, so that we can use the `?` operator to avoid a lot of the `unwrap` or `expect` methods and make the code concise.

#### Create a WasmEdge `Vm` instance

In WasmEdge Runtime, a `Vm` instance runs a wasm app via the `wasi` interface. Therefore, we pass as an argument a `Config` instance with the `wasi` option enabled when we create a `Vm` instance. Due to the enabled `wasi` option, a default wasi module named *"wasi_snapshot_preview1"* is also created while creating the new `Vm` instance.

```rust
...

// `main` function has a return type
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // create a config with the `wasi` option enabled
    let config = ConfigBuilder::new(CommonConfigOptions::default())
        .with_host_registration_config(HostRegistrationConfigOptions::default().wasi(true))
        .build()?;
    assert!(config.wasi_enabled());

    // create a VM with the config
    let mut vm = Vm::new(Some(config))?;

    Ok(())
}
```

#### Initialize the default wasi module

Here is a thing to be noticed: to use the export functions in the default wasi module, it is required to initialize the default wasi module with the necessary arguments specified by users. In this example, we just pass three default values `None` to the `initialize` method.

```Rust
...

// `main` function has a return type
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    ...
  
  	// get the default wasi module in Vm, and then
  	// initialize it with the default arguments
  	vm.wasi_module()?.initialize(None, None, None);

    Ok(())
}
```

#### Register and Run `wasm-app.wasm`

In the previous steps we have set up a WasmEdge `Vm` instance, and now, we can register the wasm app into the `Vm` instance and run it. `wasmedge-sdk` crate defines three APIs in the `Vm` object for registering wasm modules:

- [`register_module_from_file`](https://wasmedge.github.io/WasmEdge/wasmedge_sdk/struct.Vm.html#method.register_module_from_file) registers a wasm module from the given wasm file into the `Vm` instance.
- [`register_module_from_bytes`](https://wasmedge.github.io/WasmEdge/wasmedge_sdk/struct.Vm.html#method.register_module_from_bytes) registers a wasm module from the given in-memory wasm bytes into the `Vm` instance.
- [`register_module`](https://wasmedge.github.io/WasmEdge/wasmedge_sdk/struct.Vm.html#method.register_module) registers a compiled wasm module into the `Vm` instance.

In this tutorial, we use the `register_module_from_file` API to register the `wasm-app.wasm` file into the `Vm` instance directly:

```Rust
...

// `main` function has a return type
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    ...

  	// register the `wasm-app.wasm` file as a wasm module named "wasm-app" into vm
  	let wasm_app_file = "<your-path>/workspace/wasm-app/target/wasm32-wasi/release/wasm-app.wasm"
  	let vm = vm.register_module_from_file("wasm-app", &wasm_app_file)?;
  
    Ok(())
}
```

Now, we run the wasm app by calling the `_start`<sup>[6]</sup> wasm function in the `wasm-app` wasm module:

```rust
...

// `main` function has a return type
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    ...

  	// run the wasm app by calling the `_start` function defined
  	// in the `wasm-app` wasm module. `_start` is the counterpart
  	// of the `main` function in the `wasm-app` application project
  	vm.run_func(Some("wasm-app"), "_start", params!())?;
  
    Ok(())
}
```

><div id="start-func"></div>
>
>[6] The `main` function in a wasm app is exported as a wasm function named `_start`.

### Step 3: Run `run-wasm-app` to call `wasm-app`

By far we have already finished all coding tasks. We can navigate into the directory `workspace/run-wasm-app` in the termial program, then run the following command:

```bash
// in workspace/run-wasm-app
cargo run
```

The command will compile and run the `run-wasm-app` program that will further invoke the `wasm-app` wasm app. If the command runs successfully, then the greetings message should be printed out in the terminal:

```bash
Greetings from wasm-app!
```

## Wrapping-up

In this tutorial, we presented calling a wasm app in a host application. We compared the wasm app with a general Rust app, imported the `wasmedge-sdk` crate into the host application and introduced the following objects and the APIs:

- `Config` is used to set up a `Vm` instance by enabling or disabling configuration options.
- `Vm` represents a WasmEdge virtual machine, in which we can register modules, run wasm functions, and etc..
- We can register a wasm module from a wasm file into a `Vm` instance with its  `register_module_from_file` API.
- In adition, we can also use `register_module_from_bytes` and `register_module` APIs to register a wasm module from wasm bytes and a module, respectively.
